These are some of the projects I have made learning with Code Institute. I have transferred them here for organizaional purposes. 

Love Running: For this project, I've learned how HTML and CSS work together to produce appealing, responsive websites.
I've also built a fully functioning, static website in pure HTML and CSS from scratch. The Love Running acts a site for users to get information about running in Dublin. With a gallery of photos to look at as well.

Resume Project: The resume project is a practice for a resume of Rosie Odenkirk. It's use is for the users to look at this potential employee and find out more information about Rosie. It uses Bootstrap to give a responsive design and is given a sleek design to attract the users to Rosie's abilities. 

Love Maths:  This project was built with JavaScript. Love Maths is a game using addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Where the user can click on each image and will be encountered with a maths question. There is also a count of how many answers the user get correct/wrong.

Thorin: This is a project using the basics of Flask to display Thorin and other charatcers in LOTR/Hobbit. This is the first project with Python and is a basic layout and focused more on the backend of understanding of how Flask runs. The github link is [here](https://github.com/LaneSawyerT/flask).
