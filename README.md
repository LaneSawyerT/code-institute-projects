Welcome LaneSawyerT,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **September 1, 2021**


Love Running: For this project, I've learned how HTML and CSS work together to produce appealing, responsive websites.
I've also built a fully functioning, static website in pure HTML and CSS from scratch. The Love Running acts a site for users to get information about running in Dublin. With a gallery of photos to look at as well.

Resume Project: The resume project is a practice for a resume of Rosie Odenkirk. It's use is for the users to look at this potential employee and find out more information about Rosie. It uses Bootstrap to give a responsive design and is given a sleek design to attract the users to Rosie's abilities. 

Love Maths:  This project was built with JavaScript. Love Maths is a game using addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Where the user can click on each image and will be encountered with a maths question. There is also a count of how many answers the user get correct/wrong.

Thorin: This is a project using the basics of Flask to display Thorin and other charatcers in LOTR/Hobbit. This is the first project with Python and is a basic layout and focused more on the backend of understanding of how Flask runs. The github link is [https://github.com/LaneSawyerT/flask](here).
